No medicine or vaccine for Covid-19 has been made in the world yet. It has brought perhaps the fastest, starkest change to working patterns around the world in living memory.\u00a0\u00a0The Covid-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. So, it\u2019s vital to maintain respiratory etiquette.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to stop &amp; slow down the spreading is by maintaining social distance. Protect yourself &amp; others by washing your hands frequently and avoid touching your face.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, all international and commercial flights have been canceled and closed all over the world.

Many flights have been canceled and many have had their visas suspended again. However, almost all the international airlines have extended the ticket deadlines of their customers and have also arranged ticket refunds for many. However, many of them had visa priorities or many of them could not go even after their visas expired and they have been suspended for six months or they have been informed that they will decide after all is well. Also, with the pandemic spreading globally at a rapid pace, many countries have introduced strict controls on domestic and foreign travel. However, this has left tourists stranded who are stuck in different countries all around the world. Governments are working to repatriate those facing difficulty but others do not know when they will see home again.

Personal responsibility is the most important step that people can take to protect themselves and others.<\/p>\n<p>Global coordination and cooperation are needed to create and distribute medical equipment, testing kits, anti-infective special clothing, and artificial respiration necessary for the prevention and treatment of corona infections.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the news spread in various electronic media, it seems that we at mercy of Covid-19 at this moment. But we cling to the hope of survival &amp; a better tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>It is absolutely necessary for oneself and society to do one&#8217;s best to deal with the crisis without putting oneself in the hands of destiny.
